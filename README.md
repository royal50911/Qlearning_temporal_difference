# Qlearning_temporal_difference
Reinforcement learning using Q-learning algorithm in which the probabilistic models that we used to solve the MDP problem are not known and have to be learned. Compare the 'optimal' policies that we obtained using reinforcement learning with the true optimal policies when the model was perfectly known.
